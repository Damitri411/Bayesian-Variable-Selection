# 1. Horseshoe prior 

The horse-shoe prior is a strong prior, used for variable selection, intending local-global shrinkage. Refer to this paper for more information

# 2. Bayesian Lasso

Lasso is indeed a popular technique for variable selection , but its functional form makes optimization of the likelihood difficult, even in the bayesian setting, hence a hiearchical model was employed to achieve the same likelihood (as for lasso), but with a greater flexibility of sampling from the  rather "well known" posterior distribution obtained as a result. This also makes it easy for obtaining the hyper parameter "lambda", which was previously obtained using cross validation. Refer to this paper for more information

# 3. Kuo-Mallik
 
 Along with finding which variable is important, this method also lets you know what is the probability of inclusion of each variable , is in the model. Based on these probabilities, the researcher can now judge if the variable is at all important or not.
